# Open Street Map Gazetteer

The osmgaz provides a gazetteer that sits on top of the Open Street Map (OSM) data and can be used to retrieve both a containment hierarchy and proximal toponyms for a given location.

It uses a hierarchical classification system and automatically maps all OSM features into the classification system.

It also provides salience calculation, that can be used to rank the proximal toponyms.

**Unmaintained**: The gazetteer was developed for a research project, but is no longer maintained or used by me. Please feel free to use it however you wish. If you use it in a research project or publication, please cite:
